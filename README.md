This PHP script handles file uploads and generates a text file containing the URLs of the uploaded files for download. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. Function generateRandomString: This function generates a random string of alphanumeric characters. It's likely intended for generating unique folder names.
2. POST Request Handling: The script checks if the request method is POST.
3. Folder Creation: It retrieves the folder name from the POST data and creates the folder if it doesn't already exist.
4. File Upload Handling: It loops through each uploaded file:
Retrieves file information such as name, size, and extension.
Validates the file extension and size.
Moves the uploaded file to the destination folder.
Constructs the URL of the uploaded file and adds it to an array ($urls).
5. URL Modification: It replaces spaces in the URLs with "%20" (URL encoding).
6. Text Content Preparation: It concatenates the modified URLs with line breaks to create the content of the text file ($txt_content).
7. Download Trigger: It sends HTTP headers to trigger the download of the text file:
Sets the content type to plain text.
Specifies the filename for download.
Sets the content length.
Outputs the text content.
8. Exit: The script exits after echoing the text content to prevent any additional output.

This script essentially allows users to upload files, and upon submission, it generates a text file containing the URLs of the uploaded files, which can be downloaded by the user.
